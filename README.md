## My process

First, I created the entire HTML structure using sections and divs while trying to imagine the order. Then, I defined all the color variables in the root, and finally, I began to write all the CSS, comparing it with the design image I had. I started with the desktop version and then moved on to the mobile version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### Continued development

I want to learn how to use more variables for cleaner code and better time optimization.
